## Introduction

I recently finished an anime called [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu){:target="_blank"}. I loved it, primarily because of the care it took in exploring themes like war, heroism, populism, social hierarchies, human nature, leadership styles, inherent morality in systems of government, and more. I won't spoil any major plot details, but one of the main characters was a military officer named Yang Wen-li. Yang was known for his genius battle tactics and incredible wisdom that — coupled with his easygoing and humble disposition — made him a true stand out among men of war.

In the anime, he becomes the mentor of an early career officer named Julian. Julian admires Yang and shows this by meticulously chronicling Yang's tactics, personal history, and words of wisdom. Julian's dedication to capturing Yang's essence in written form earned him ridicule from some of his peers. They thought him lacking in ambition, in pride, in drive for the shadow of a great name and reputation, separate from that of Yang's. Julian however paid them no mind. He believed Yang to be a once in a generation sort of leader, the kind who people, both present and future, could stand to learn from. Julian's ambition therefore was to accurately record all things Yang Wen-li. He believed this would benefit many millions who could learn from Yang's life and teachings.

I imagine the apostles of Jesus Christ felt like Julian in their own quests to record the words, acts and life of, not only their mentor, but Lord as well. And much like Julian, they endured scorn for their zeal, but sojourned on regardless. As a follower of Christ myself, I felt inspired by Julian's dedication to Yang Wen-li. There's however no need for me to record the life of Jesus Christ, as that work has long since been finished. What I can do though is provide something akin to the thematic organization, topical partitioning, logical indexing, or simply put, [cliff notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CliffsNotes){:target="_blank"}, of Christ words. Jesus made it rather simple in explaining what it meant to truly follow him, to love him.

> If you love Me, keep My commandments.

So, if you're wondering "what are his commandments?", you've come to the right place. This article serves as a list of commands issued by Jesus Christ throughout the Bible. By "commands", I mean any instance in which Jesus Christ gave instruction or direction requiring some form of action from the hearer. I'm excluding commands that — when read in context — could not reasonably be viewed as general instruction. For example, when Jesus [told a guy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+21%3A+2-3&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"} to go to a village, untie a donkey, and bring it back, that was a command, but certainly not one meant for continued application (there aren't even donkey's where I live!). As such, I've stuck to listing only those commands that are unambiguously perpetual in nature.

## The Commands of Christ

The commands listed below were taken from the [New King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_King_James_Version){:target="_blank"} of the Bible. No guarantees on this list being exhaustive, as its compilation was the work of but one man. If there's a command you were expecting to see but didn't, feel free to let me know in the comment section below, or via my [contact page](/contact){:target="_blank"}. I'd be more than happy to update the list!
