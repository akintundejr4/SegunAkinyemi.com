I recently finished an anime called [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu){:target="_blank"}. I loved it, primarily because of the care it took in deeply exploring themes such as human nature, war, heroism, populism, the inherent morality of certain systems of government, social hierarchies, leadership styles and more. I won't spoil any major plot details, but one of the main characters was a military officer named Yang Wen-li. Yang was known for his incredible wisdom and genius battle tactics that — coupled with his easygoing and humble disposition — made him a true stand-out amidst men of war. He became a tutor/mentor during the anime of an early career officer named Julian. Julian admired Yang, and one of the ways he showed this was by chronicling the words of advice and wisdom that Yang shared with him. Julian's dedication to Yang was zealous in ways that earned him ridicule from some of his peers. Julian however paid them no mind, as he was so enamored with the person of Yang that preserving his words and making them available to others was his chief aim, no matter the cost.

Well, I'm a Christian, and as great as Yang Wen-li was in Legend of the Galactic Heroes, I rate Jesus immeasurably higher. I thought Julian's dedication to recording Yang's word was admirable, so I've taken to trying something like it myself, with Jesus as the focus. Forutnaely, Jesus's words are aleady recorded, so one need only organize them into topic groups. So here's a listing of times in the Bible where Jesus Christ issued a command. The quotes are in the [New King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_King_James_Version){:target="_blank"} of the Bible.
