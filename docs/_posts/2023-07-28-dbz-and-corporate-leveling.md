## Shattering the Scouter

There's no denying the enduring legacy of [Dragon Ball Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z){:target="_blank"}. To this day, it continues to influence music, sports, television, film, social media, and popular culture overall, cementing its lasting relevance. Even if you've never seen an episode, you've probably stumbled upon references to the show, maybe without even recognizing them! We have it to thank for one of the [greatest memes of all time](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-over-9000){:target="_blank"}, namely [Vegeta's](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Vegeta){:target="_blank"} dumbfounded "It's over 9000!" remark after assessing [Goku's](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Goku){:target="_blank"} power level with a [scouter](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Scouter){:target="_blank"} device.

Vegeta, the proud prince of Sayians, arrived on Earth with conquering ambitions. Armed with a device capable of gauging an individual's power level (combat ability), he believed that Earth lacked anyone who could challenge him or his invading party. Vegeta was obsessed with strength and believed a person's worth was directly correlated to their power level. He'd only met a few select individuals in the galaxy with a power level greater than his own, one of whom destroyed his home planet (the scheming cosmic despot [Frieza](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Frieza)). Consequently, there was a range of power levels that he (and the scouter) considered normal. In his view, sentient creatures fell within an established range, of which he was on the higher end. To possess a power level beyond what the scouter could measure was unconscionable. That was until Goku — a displaced Sayian, raised on Earth and thus unaware of his heritage ([like Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman){:target="_blank"}) — was scanned, revealing a power level far beyond what the scouter could measure. And so, the iconic "It's over 9000!" meme was born, marked by Vegeta's furious destruction of the now-useless device.

Vegeta went on to be defeated by Goku, further solidifying that his previous notions of power were flawed. It was the start of his long journey towards understanding that for many species — Sayians in particular — there was no limit to their power. It was only a matter of how hard they were willing to work to grow stronger. Goku had devoted himself to surpassing his limits time and time again, scouring the planet for worthy opponents to challenge. He didn't grow up with a scouter telling him when he'd reached the "next level" of power. Instead, he went out and challenged himself, and knew he had advanced when he could beat someone or do something he couldn't before. To Goku, there was no concept of power levels as a limit to one's abilities. There was only the continual pursuit of being better today than you were yesterday. With no upper bound on his concept of power, Goku's potential was limitless.

## The Perils of Corporate Leveling

So what does any of this have to do with corporate leveling? Well, as a Software Engineer at a tech company, I've become familiar with the leveling system used to organize employees and determine things like compensation, job duties, and decision-making responsibilities. While companies may use different numbers and letters to define their levels, the concepts remain the same across them. Employees are hired at a certain level and must meet a set of criteria before being promoted to the next. This often includes producing work associated with their target level while still at their current level. In short, leveling is instrumental to an employee's experience, particularly when it comes to compensation and expectations. There's a great website called [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/){:target="_blank"} that organizes leveling data for large companies. It has the most accurate insights you'll find anywhere about compensation for various levels and how those of one company measure up against those at another. If you've ever browsed the professional social network [Blind](https://teamblind.com/){:target="_blank"}, you'll see employees from across big tech congregating to discuss, debate, and seek advice related to leveling and what their compensation, job duties, and promotion velocity should be. Just like Vegeta, many of us define ourselves by a leveling system that determines our worth, potential, and power within an organization. There are good reasons for having levels, but things become dangerous when we start thinking about our careers only within the linear bounds of our corporate employer's leveling system.

I recently had lunch with a coworker who had switched to a new team and was unhappy with his situation. As we discussed his concerns, it became clear that making another move, either internally or externally, would be best for him. He'd been applying internally for other positions, but only at his current job level. Why? Because our company, like many others, has a strict leveling system that governs career progression. There's a sort of unspoken rule that internal transfers must be horizontal. You typically aren't able to go up a level by switching teams. My colleague was concerned that internal hiring managers would only consider him for a position at the same level as his current one. While this conventional wisdom was true, there was something about it that didn’t sit right with me. Internally, I've seen people who are at a lower level than me produce the same level of value for our team, but they haven't been promoted. On the other hand, I've seen people who are at a higher level than me produce less value than you'd expect. We're told that to be promoted, we must be operating at our target level for some arbitrary amount of time before getting the boost. What I've found is that there were plenty of people company-wide with demonstrated skill beyond their current level, but who hadn't yet been promoted. Many of them experience a form of [impostor syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585058/){:target="_blank"}, wherein they start believing they're not good enough for that next level, despite evidence to the contrary.

And so, when my colleague shared that he was only applying to positions at his current level, something clicked in my mind opened, and the idea for this article was born. I said then, as I write now, that we ought to "forget the whole leveling system", although I may have used more colorful language during the conversation. The system is imperfect, subjective, and varies across teams and organizations. One team might consider you "junior," yet another team within the same company might regard your input as "senior" for their specific projects and goals. The company-wide leveling system is standardized, which means it doesn't factor in the unique dynamics of each project. Ostensibly, managers are supposed to fill in the nuance, but they're only human. Sometimes they don't get things right, and other times politics and bureaucracy beyond their control can prevent someone from being promoted. There are plenty of people whose level could be considered changeable based on the team or project their working on. It's all relative man. It’s all relative.

## Don't Limit Yourself

While I understand the merits of corporate leveling systems, I can't help but feel that we the worker bees, the commoners, the cogs in the machine, are doing ourselves a disservice by viewing our career trajectories through them. What if we broke the scouter? What if we became more like Goku, always striving to be better, fearlessly pursuing our goals, and not letting any person or arbitrary leveling system dictate our worth? That's the advice I had for my colleague. Forget the leveling system. Toss the scouter. Apply to any position that interests you, regardless of your current level. Don't let the job description intimidate you. The bullet points were probably written by an [SEO-obsessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization){:target="_blank"} recruiter shoving in keywords in hopes of finding the perfect candidate. But we don't live in a perfect world. If you're passionate about the role, you're already halfway there. Sometimes you grow into a position. You can't always wait until a leveling system tells you you're ready before you [take the plunge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/take-the-plunge){:target="_blank"}.

</p>

Now, of course, be reasonable. Don’t go applying for a job as a brain surgeon when you've no background, experience, or training in the field. That’s a waste of your time, and that of the hiring team, who like you are deserving of respect. However, if there's a job you're interested in, and maybe you don't meet all the requirements, or it's a step or two above your company's imperfect (and subjective) leveling of your abilities, don't be discouraged. Apply. The leveling system is flawed. It has hits and misses. It has people who are over-leveled and some who are under-leveled. Budget restrictions often prevent companies from promoting (or demoting?) employees at a rate that addresses inequalities in the system. Someone's getting the [short end of the stick](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/get-the-short-end-of-the-stick){:target="_blank"}. Don't let it be you.

Don’t wait around for your company to finally put you on the "right" level. Don't limit your potential or aspirations based on the company's current estimation of your abilities. If you apply to a position and don’t get it, that’s alright. Don’t let some corporate leveling system stop you from pursuing an opportunity you’re interested in. Don't be defeated before you've even tried. Imagine if Goku only fought people with power levels lower than his own. He'd have never become a [Super Saiyan](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan){:target="_blank"}. You can't win if you don't even play. Put yourself out there and see what happens. [Shooters shoot](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shooters%20shoot){:target="_blank"}, take your shot.
