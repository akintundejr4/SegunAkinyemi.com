## Introduction

I recently finished an anime called [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu){:target="_blank"}. I loved it, primarily because of the care it took in exploring themes like war, heroism, populism, social hierarchies, human nature, leadership styles, inherent morality in systems of government, and more. I won't spoil any major plot details, but one of the main characters was a military officer named Yang Wen-li. Yang was known for his genius battle tactics and incredible wisdom that — coupled with his easygoing and humble disposition — made him a true stand out among men of war.

In the anime, he becomes the mentor of an early career officer named Julian. Julian admires Yang and shows this by meticulously chronicling Yang's tactics, personal history, and words of wisdom. Julian's dedication to capturing Yang's essence in written form earned him ridicule from some of his peers. They thought him lacking in ambition, in pride, in drive for the shadow of a great name and reputation, separate from that of Yang's. Julian however paid them no mind. He believed Yang to be a once in a generation sort of leader, the kind who people, both present and future, could stand to learn from. Julian's ambition therefore was to accurately record all things Yang Wen-li. He believed this would benefit many millions who could learn from Yang's life and teachings.

I imagine the apostles of Jesus Christ felt like Julian in their own quests to record the words, acts and life of, not only their mentor, but Lord as well. And much like Julian, they endured scorn for their zeal, but sojourned on regardless. As a follower of Christ myself, I felt inspired by Julian's dedication to Yang Wen-li. There's however no need for me to record the life of Jesus Christ, as that work has long since been finished. What I can do though is provide something akin to the thematic organization, topical partitioning, logical indexing, or simply put, [cliff notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CliffsNotes){:target="_blank"}, of Christ words. Jesus made it rather simple in explaining what it meant to truly follow him, to love him.

> If you love Me, keep My commandments.

So, if you're wondering "what are his commandments?", you've come to the right place. This article serves as a list of commands issued by Jesus Christ throughout the Bible. By "commands", I mean any instance in which Jesus Christ gave instruction or direction requiring some form of action from the hearer. I'm excluding commands that — when read in context — could not reasonably be viewed as general instruction. For example, when Jesus [told a guy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+21%3A+2-3&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"} to go to a village, untie a donkey, and bring it back, that was a command, but certainly not one meant for continued application (there aren't even donkey's where I live!). As such, I've stuck to listing only those commands that are perpetual in nature.

## The Commands of Christ

Many of the quotes below include the complete verses surrounding a command given by Jesus. Without that context, it becomes difficult to truly understand what he was trying to say. The commands were taken from the [New King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_King_James_Version){:target="_blank"} of the Bible. No guarantees on this list being exhaustive, as its compilation was the work of but one man. The task of determining if a given Jesus quote qualifies as a long-lived "command" is oftentimes subjective, in that the personal judgement of the preparer must be used.

If there's a command you were expecting to see but didn't, or one you see below that you don't think is a true command, feel free to let me know in the comment section below, or via my [contact page](/contact){:target="_blank"}. I'd be more than happy to update the list!

### Matthew

The commands of Jesus Christ from the [Gospel of Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew){:target="_blank"}.

>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:11-12&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:16&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.

> <cite>[Matthew 5:23-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:23-26&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast <i>it</i> from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast <i>it</i> from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:27-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:27-30&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’ But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:33-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:33-37&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have <i>your</i> cloak also. And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:38-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:38-42&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more <i>than others?</i> Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:43-48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:43-48&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:1-4&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who <i>is</i> in the secret <i>place;</i> and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen <i>do.</i> For they think that they will be heard for their many words. "Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:5-8&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who <i>is</i> in the secret <i>place;</i> and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:16-18&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

---

> "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:24&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:25-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:25-27&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day <i>is</i> its own trouble.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:31-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:31-34&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plank <i>is</i> in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

---

> "Enter by the narrow gate; for wide <i>is</i> the gate and broad <i>is</i> the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow <i>is</i> the gate and difficult <i>is</i> the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 7:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:13-14&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

---

> "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?

---

> These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts, nor bag for <i>your</i> journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food. "Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out. And when you go into a household, greet it. If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!

---

> "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues. You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

> "A disciple is not above <i>his</i> teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more <i>will they call</i> those of his household! Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.

> "Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.

And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to receive <i>it,</i> he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!

> Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid." And Peter answered Him and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water." So He said, "Come." And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!" And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"

> He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? For God commanded, saying, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’ But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me <i>is</i> a gift <i>to God</i>"— then he need not honor his father or mother.’ Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: ‘These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with <i>their</i> lips, But their heart is far from Me. And in vain they worship Me, Teaching <i>as</i> doctrines the commandments of men.’ " When He had called the multitude to <i>Himself,</i> He said to them, "Hear and understand: Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."

> Then Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees." And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "<i>It</i> <i>is</i> because we have taken no bread." But Jesus, being aware of <i>it,</i> said to them, "O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread? Do you not yet understand, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up? Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up? How is it you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread?—<i>but</i> to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." Then they understood that He did not tell <i>them</i> to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

> From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!" But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."

> Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works. "Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."

> While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!" And when the disciples heard <i>it,</i> they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. But Jesus came and touched them and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid." When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead."

> Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, and said, "Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me. "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes! "If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast <i>it</i> from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast <i>it</i> from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire.

For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. "What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that <i>sheep</i> than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.

But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector.

And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men. Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?" But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test Me, <i>you</i> hypocrites? Show Me the tax money." So they brought Him a denarius. And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription <i>is</i> this?" They said to Him, "Caesar’s." And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s." When they had heard <i>these</i> <i>words,</i> they marveled, and left Him and went their way.

Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, <i>that</i> observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do. For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay <i>them</i> on men’s shoulders; but they <i>themselves</i> will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments. They love the best places at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues, greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, ‘Rabbi, Rabbi.’ But you, do not be called ‘Rabbi’; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren. Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ. But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.

And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all <i>these things</i> must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these <i>are</i> the beginning of sorrows. "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.

Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened.
