This page is an ongoing list of curated learning resources for AI, ranging from stuff to get you started to stuff for diving deep. My goal is for this to be a targeted list, quality over quantity. None of these are affiliate links, and I'd advise against paying for AI-related content should you come across any. I've attempted to include only free resources, but some programs may start free before asking for money to get a certificate or "you did it" badge. AI education isn't exactly a novel field, but the overwhelming demand for content in the space is certainly new. This list is my attempt at [separating the wheat from the <s>shaft</s> chaff 😏](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separate%20the%20wheat%20from%20the%20chaff).

## Getting Started

Most people have heard of AI in some way (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Copilot, etc), but if you want to get started with understanding what's going on behind the scenes, here are some good resources.

### Generative AI For Everyone

This course, taught by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng){:target="_blank"} is an excellent introduction to AI for anyone regardless of background. Andrew is a big deal in the computer science/AI community, like [three legendary Sannin](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sannin){:target="_blank"} level big. As a co-founder of [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain){:target="_blank"}, he played a role in building a division that went on to [invent the "transformer" neural network architecture](https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding){:target="_blank"} upon which chatbots like ChatGPT are built (the "GPT" in "ChatGPT" stands for ["Generative Pre-trained Transformer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer){:target="_blank"}.) He also co-founded [Coursera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera){:target="_blank"}, the platform where you'll find the course. Check it out below, it's well-regarded as a great introduction to understanding Generative AI.

### Spreadsheets Are All You Need

There seems to be no limit to what can be done in Microsoft Excel. It is in many ways the foundation upon which the entire business world rests. The stuff people have pulled off in Excel is insane; like [this guy building a game engine with it](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11osft6/i_made_a_complete_game_engine_in_excel_and_then_i/){:target="_blank"}. There are companies out there whose entire existence rests on a handful of Excel spreadsheets, or one massive one masquerading as a database. Dread it, run from it, Excel [remains all the same](https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies){:target="_blank"}, for what is [<s>dead</s>](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/What_Is_Dead_May_Never_Die){:target="_blank"} Excel may never die!

MIT grad and tech entrepreneur [Ishan Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishananand/){:target="_blank"} came up with a method of teaching people about AI using Excel, and it's awesome, totally awesome. His site features a series of videos that teach how AI works using the familiar interface of a spreadsheet. It's a great low-code introduction to AI that's perfect for technical and non-technical audiences alike. Check it out below.

### Something About Prompt Engineering

## Swimming Swiftly

If you're ready to go past the basics and start getting into building, implementing, and practically using AI, here are some resources to help you out. They aren't quite as deep as dropping everything to become a full-time AI & machine learning engineer, but they're sufficient for say a software engineer, data analyst, product manager, or likewise tech-savvy individual to gain the knowledge needed to build custom AI solutions.

### Articles

### Technical Course 1

### Techincal Course 2

### Formal Training Certificate Programs

## Diving Deep

If you're set on making AI your bread and butter, then this stuff is definitely your jam (🙄🙃). For example, imagine transitioning from someone who's an expert on cars — great at building, driving, design, and recommendations — to becoming a scientist who innovates automotive tech and engine advancements from the ground up. This level of understanding goes beyond practical application (which alone is sufficient to be the AI expert at most companies) into "I want to build the next revolutionary model and help advance humanity towards [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence){:target="_blank"}". If you truly feel this way, you might also consider enrolling in a PhD program, as this level of devoted interest (with ostensibly no immediate regard for making money) is a great fit for academia.
