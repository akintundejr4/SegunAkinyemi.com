  From Fearsome to Floundering: Kang the Conqueror's Disappointing Debut in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'
excerpt: "Jonathan Majors impresses as Kang the Conqueror, but the film's lackluster conclusion leaves Marvel's new lead antagonist ineffectual, unimposing, and hard to respect."

**Warning:** This article contains spoilers for *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania*, and [Phase 4](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Phase_Four){:target="_blank"} through [Phase 5](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Phase_Five){:target="_blank"} Marvel Cinematic Universe projects.
{: .notice--warning}

Regardless of how things may start, a great ending can salvage even the worst beginnings. Unfortunately, in *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania*, it was the ending that disappointed the most. The film has been getting [roasted by critics](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/112dmty/antman_and_the_wasp_quantumania_review_thread/){:target="_blank"} despite being mostly [well-received](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ant_man_and_the_wasp_quantumania){:target="_blank"} among fans, which is typical of most Marvel media since [*Avengers: Endgame*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Endgame){:target="_blank"}. I enjoyed the film, but that's almost entirely because of [Jonathan Majors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Majors){:target="_blank"} performance as [Kang the Conqueror](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Kang_the_Conqueror){:target="_blank"}. *Quantumania* was Kang's first big screen appearance, but not quite his debut. His introduction was in the [*Loki*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)){:target="_blank"} TV show as a [variant](https://movieweb.com/mcu-variant-explained/){:target="_blank"} of the same character called [*He Who Remains*](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/He_Who_Remains){:target="_blank"}.

Although Majors played the character well, *He Who Remains* was far too eccentric, quirky, and downright silly for my tastes. He came across more like [Willy Wonka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka){:target="_blank"} than any sort of fearsome villain I'd hold in the same regard as [Thanos](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/He_Who_Remains){:target="_blank"} in all his glorious [Titan](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Titans){:target="_blank"} brutality. However, within the context of *Loki*, it's easy to understand why Kang was so Zen. *He Who Remains* is meant to be an older more mature version of the character that's already triumphed. He now lives concealed as a god-like figure devoted to [multiverse stability](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Timeline){:target="_blank"} by any means necessary. With that in mind, although I didn't like the portrayal, I understood it. What I was looking forward to though was future iterations of Kang that would embody his title of **the Conqueror** with all the menacing regality it's meant to carry.

*Quantumania* was that awaited future iteration, and boy did Jonathan Majors deliver. Kang felt commanding, sufficiently haughty, and refreshingly grandiose in a way apt for his role as Marvel's new Avengers-level threat. That is, up until the film's final act where all that momentum was deplorably derailed.

## The Conqueror Conquered

I understand that Ant-Man and the Wasp must reign victorious in a film bearing their names, but I wish it would've been done in a way that didn't render Kang impotent. Through the first two-thirds of the film, Kang was shown to have a formidable array of powers. [Janet van Dyne](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Janet_van_Dyne){:target="_blank"} — in 30 years of trying to end Kang's rule of the Quantum realm — declared the man virtually impossible to stop, so long as his suit was intact. We're even given a montage that shows Kang decimating civilizations, planets, and entire universes with powers rivaling, if not surpassing, the [infinity stones](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Stones){:target="_blank"}. By the film's final act, Kang has been effectively crowned the next "big bad" of the MCU. It's abundantly clear he's more than *just* an Ant-Man villain like [Darren Cross](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/M.O.D.O.K.){:target="_blank"} or [Ghost](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost){:target="_blank"}. His power and ambitions are worthy of a full-on [Avengers assemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXgoJs7_HDY){:target="_blank"} kind of moment, and as such, should've been well beyond the prowess of Scott Lang and his rag-tag crew. However, in service of a plot that stayed true to the Marvel formula, *Quantumania* ends with Kang's defeat, and not just by some lucky technicality. Kang the Conqueror was straight-up overpowered.  

The decision to have Kang's film debut conclude with defeat at the hands of a B-level Avenger, his sidekicks, and some ants is more than strange, it's downright perplexing. This is different than the defeat of *He Who Remains* Kang in *Loki* because in *Quantumania* he was actually defending himself. In the show, Kang let Loki and Sylvie choose their destiny, and that of the multiverse at large, even if it meant his death. It was a very god-like [Garden of Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden){:target="_blank"} move that demonstrated just how above it all *He Who Remains* really was. However, in *Quantumania* the opposite is true. Kang is anything but a benevolent overseer, he's a man on a mission, willing to commit any manner of atrocity in pursuit of his goal. That was made clear when his reaction to being reminded that his plans would kill trillions was "I wish that mattered". The man is unyielding, ruthless, and downright diabolical. We're meant to fear him, and throughout most of the film, I did. That's why watching him in the final battle:

* Stand dormant for far too long as the heroes ravaged his city.
* Fail to use his previously demonstrated telekinetic abilities.
* Fail to use his previously demonstrated planet-destroying "blue power blast".
* Opt for what amounted to Dragon Ball Z [finger beams](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Finger_Beam){:target="_blank"} in a 1 vs *many* fight.
* Be nearly bested in hand-to-hand combat by the affable Ant-Man.
* Get overpowered by — admittedly technologically advanced — ants.

Was jarring, to say the least. *Quantumania* did such an excellent job of building Kang up, only to have him fall spectacularly in a way that damages his brand for future MCU appearances.

## Aren't You the Guy That Got Bodied by Ant-Man?

Yeah yeah I know, it was Ant-Man, the Wasp, Cassie Lang, Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, a few heroic plebeians, and some ants. But still, it was hardly the kind of crew you'd expect to take down a villain of Kang the Conqueror's power and magnitude.

Going forward, I'm going to remember Kang as the guy who couldn't fight his way out of an Ant-Man movie. Marvel can produce as many variants of him as they like, it won't matter. He can don a thousand new suits, it won't matter. He can power up, as I'm sure he will for future Avengers films, and it won't matter. He got bodied by Ant-Man and his motley crew of equal or lesser-powered heroes, plus some ants. For that, to me, he'll always be...

Thanos would never! At least when we saw him take losses in battle, it was on fields that included heavy hitters like [Scarlet Witch](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Scarlet_Witch){:target="_blank"}, [Captain Marvel](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Marvel){:target="_blank"}, and [Thor](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Thor){:target="_blank"}, some of the strongest MCU heroes to date.

I'm not alone in my disappointment over Kang's demise in *Quantumania*. You can find plenty of articles online saying the same thing, including [this](https://collider.com/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-kang-the-conqueror-introduction/){:target="_blank"} great one. There's also social media where many fans have expressed mirroring sentiments. Here are a few highlights from Reddit.

<div class="quote-container" markdown="1">

> For all the talk about the 'Conqueror' in the first half, they made him pretty underpowered in the finale. He should have decimated Ant-Man and cemented his place as the new big baddie after Thanos in the MCU. Like seriously, his beam made random people obliterate to dust but just throws back the main characters against the wall. Plot armour, I know but still it doesn't make sense at all.

> Remember how he telekinetically lifted them up in the cell? Just completely forgot that power during the 1v3 fight. Or how he casually swatted Scott/Hope? Nope lol. Marvel has a huge problem with power inconsistencies and people getting stronger or weaker when the plot needs it instead of good writing and a plot line for why the heroes win. Edit: oh and also, Kang goes "I've killed so many avengers" and then just loses. What a joke.

> To be fair, this is the Kang that was weak enough to be exiled. This variant talked himself up like he wanted to be He Who Remains but couldn't beat the council. But yeah, it does feel a bit off having the big bad of the saga lose his first outing. Thanos didn't hit the battlefield until much later and when he did he felt unstoppable.

> They made his suit broken in the end which is why he did hand to hand combat. But even then, he should have easily beaten ant man. In the trailer they really made it seem like he was going to absolute DESTROY antman.

> This version of Kang being "killed" by Ant-Man of all people and then following it up with that (council of Kang's post-credit) scene kinda of ruined the whole idea of him being the big new main villain for me, just embarrassing.

> This dude is suppose to be the next big villain? He went in a fist fight with [f'ing] ant man and managed to lose. Allegedly, he also died in Loki. So he is just basically a guy who dies over and over (?) Even human villains seemed more threatening.

> [Kang] seemed like he could easily kill anyone with his force powers at the beginning, but never uses them again after the interrogation scene.

> So you're telling me that Kang, who's faced hundreds of rebellions, conquered a lot of worlds, killed a lot of Avengers, lost because of an invasion by ants????? Don't know what u think, but it has to be lazy writing for me.

> <cite>[u/caraxes_meleys](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/113p6ky/comment/j8ris6w){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Kang failed so spectacularly, and couldn't kill a single person ... this is the Kang that the council was afraid of? ... In comparison, first movie Thanos is actually properly introduced, he immediately kills Loki and kicks Hulk's [butt] without an issue in a [f'ing] FIST FIGHT. That's how you introduce an actual big bad, not whatever this was.

> <cite>[u/braujo](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/113p6ky/comment/j8tl79a){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> I can't believe they "killed" Kang The Conqueror. The whole movie he looks so menacing, he speaks about crushing rebellions and killing avengers. And in the end, Ant-Man kicks his [butt]. Even if he didn't die, how can we take him as an avengers-level threat now? Oh, and I can't believe they changed the ending. "We both have to lose" that line loses all meaning and the way the portal appears right behind them clearly added in post made us all laugh at the cinema.

## Fandom Undeterred

All in all, Jonathan Majors delivers a menacing performance as Kang the Conqueror, but *Quantumania*'s conclusion leaves him diminished, in both power and reputation, undermining his potential as the next major MCU villain. Kang's certainly still redeemable, primarily because of Majors' superb depiction, but it's going to take some work.

As a fan of the MCU, whether they redeem him or not, I'm going to keep watching. I'm not mad, upset, or saddened by what I saw in the film. It is seriously not that serious. I wrote this article from a Barnes & Noble down the street from the theater while enjoying a magnificent salted caramel cookie. I was smiling like an idiot the whole time. This whole thing of comic book superheroes getting big-budget adaptions is a dream come true for me, even as just a spectator. I had fun seeing *Quantumania* in theaters, and I'll have fun seeing whatever the MCU puts out next. No matter what the future holds, I'm going to enjoy this ride we call the Marvel Cinematic Universe, wherever it may go.
