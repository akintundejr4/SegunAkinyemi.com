The *Imitation of Christ* is a Christian devotional written by late medieval period author [Thomas à Kempis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_%C3%A0_Kempis){:target="_blank"}. It's one of the most popular Christian devotional books of all time, and one that I only just recently completed. How I wish I had read it sooner! It's one of those books you truly shouldn't rush through, as doing so would rob you of the opportunity to fully digest the dense messaging.
