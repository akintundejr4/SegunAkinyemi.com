Here's some of what I've worked on.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/card.css">

<script src="/assets/js/card-generator.js"></script>

<a href="https://github.com/segunak/Mortality-Analysis"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/segunak/Mortality-Analysis.svg"></a>

Goal

1. Have a list of repos. Whether you set this in configuration, get the featured repos, whatever, have a list of repo names
2. For each repo, create a card. You need to produce a html element, which creates an iframe, for each one. You also need to 
pass in teh repo name and it's associated details.
