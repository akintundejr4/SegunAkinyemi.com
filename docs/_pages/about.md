Hello there, I'm Segun Akinyemi (pronounced sheh-goon ah-key-yem-ee), and I'm glad you're here. This website is a place where I share my passions and interests, such as faith, software, technology, literature, entertainment, and more.

For a bit of background about me, I grew up in Seattle, Washington, but in 2014, I made my way to the [Midwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States){:target="_blank"} to attend [Lindenwood University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenwood_University){:target="_blank"} in St. Charles, Missouri. If you're wondering how I ended up there, I'll admit I didn't exactly choose Lindenwood out of a sea of options. The truth is, the athletic scholarship they offered me was my only shot at being able to afford college. During my time there, I competed as a [track & field](https://lindenwoodlions.com/sports/mens-track-and-field/roster/akintunde-akinyemi/11246){:target="_blank"} athlete in the [high jump](https://www.worldathletics.org/athletes/united-states/akintunde-akinyemi-14736806){:target="_blank"} while studying Computer Information Systems, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in 2018. Looking back, I truly believe that attending Lindenwood was a part of God's plan for my life. It wasn't a perfect school by any means, but it was perfect for me at that time in my life, and I'm grateful for the experience. Shortly thereafter, I continued my education at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis){:target="_blank"}, earning a Master of Science in Information Systems Management in 2020.

Now as a working professional, I'm a software engineer, but like to style myself more broadly as an all-around tech enthusiast. I'm fascinated by technology and its potential to change the world. I consider myself fortunate to have been born in an era of digital innovation and problem-solving, and I'm eager to see where the future takes us. If you're wondering what I'm up to now career-wise, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/segunakinyemi){:target="_blank"}.

As a person, I strive to live my life in a way that emulates the character of Jesus Christ. His words guide my life, my definition of who I am, and my understanding of what's truly important. I could speak at length on this topic, but this page is meant to be only a _brief_ introduction, so I'll refrain. Instead, I leave you with one of my [favorite quotes]({% post_url 2022-06-21-favorite-quotes %}){:target="_blank"} below.

> Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in heaven.

> <cite>Matthew 5:16</cite>

All that being said, thanks for visiting. Feel free to explore!
