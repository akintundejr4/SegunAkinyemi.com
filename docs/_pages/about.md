I'm Segun Akinyemi (pronounced sheh-goon ah-key-yem-ee), welcome to my personal website. This place serves as a digital home for my various passions and interests, including but not limited to software, technology, literature, faith, entertainment and more.

For a bit of background on me, I grew up in Seattle, Washington but ended up moving out to the midwest for college. I went to Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri, graduating with Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems in 2018. During my time at Lindenwood, I competed as a track & field athlete in the [high jump](https://lindenwoodlions.com/sports/mens-track-and-field/roster/akintunde-akinyemi/11246){:target="_blank"}. I was no Olympian, but I wasn't too shabby either! Shortly thereafter, I studied at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, graduating with a Master of Science in Information Systems Management in 2020.

Now as a working professional, I'm a software engineer, but like to style myself more broadly as an all around tech enthusiast. I'm fascinated by technology and its ability to transform lives, careers, companies, markets, industries, and entire nations. I consider myself privileged to have been born in this digital age of problem solving, innovation and advancement using technology. If you're wondering what I'm up to now career-wise, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/segunakinyemi){:target="_blank"}.

As a person, I'd summarize myself as someone striving to emulate the character of Jesus Christ in the way that I live. His words guide my life, my definition of who I am, and my understanding of what's truly important. I could speak at length on this topic, but this page is meant to be only a _brief_ introduction, so I'll refrain. Instead, I leave you with one of my [favorite quotes]({% post_url 2022-06-21-favorite-quotes %}){:target="_blank"} below.

> Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in heaven.

> <cite>Matthew 5:16</cite>

All that being said, thanks for visiting my website. Feel free to explore!
